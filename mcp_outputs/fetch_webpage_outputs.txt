Query: SerpAPI rate limit delay requests
Context snippet:
- Hourly throughput limit: plans under 1M searches/month allow 20% of plan volume per hour (e.g., 5,000/mo => 1,000/hour).
- Recommendation: spread searches evenly throughout each hour for best performance.
- Successful searches count; cached/errored searches do not consume credits.
